# MouseHunt - Journal Historian

Move over Mythweaver, we're writing our own journal's history now.

1. Saves a local copy of all your Hunter's Journal entries.
    
    a. Click the "Infinite." button at the bottom of your journal to see the "Infinite view" of your entire saved history.
    
        i. Currently this has a bug where it stops working if you press the Camp button anytime after a full page refresh. Refresh the page to make the Infinite view work again.
    
    b. Only saves what gets loaded on the page, so load older pages if you've been away from your device where you store your history for a while.
    
    c. Click the button again to go back to the regular journal length.
  
2. Adds category filters to your Hunter's Journal to declutter your journal by hiding unwanted categories.

    a. Hover your journal header to see and turn your filters on/off.
    
    b. Your filter options are saved and also apply to the Infinite view.
