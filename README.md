Saves journal entries and offers more viewing options

Saves journal entries that are loaded on the page to local storage, which can then be viewed with the "Infinite." button by the journal page buttons.

Also adds filter buttons that are visible when hovering over the journal header, which filters the journal entries by type to make the infinite view more useful.
